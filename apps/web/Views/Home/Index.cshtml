    <p>
        Do <em>you</em> have an alt problem? Struggling to remember which of your characters
        have done all of the things this week? WoWthing is here to help manage your
        <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/">World of Warcraft</a> characters!
    </p>

    <p>
        WoWthing is free and will (hopefully) always be free. I have no interest in running ads
        or charging for premium functionality, and since everything is open source someone else
        could just host a free version anyway.
    </p>

    <p>Let's take a quick tour:</p>

            <p>
                The at-a-glance view of your characters. Most of the columns are configurable,
                this is an example of absolutely everything being enabled. The faded rows at
                the bottom are characters on an inactive account.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>NOTE:</strong> most of this functionality requires saved data from the
                <a href="https://curseforge.com/wow/addons/wowthing-collector">WoWthing_Collector</a>
                addon to be uploaded - gold, mount speed, weekly quests (Anima/Shaping Fate/Souls),
                Mythic+ keystone, Mythic+ vault.
            </p>

        <div class="landing-feature">
            <h2>Currencies</h2>
            <img src="img/currencies_20210704.png" alt="Screenshot of WoWthing Currencies view">
            <p>
                Keep track of how much of each currency all of your characters have. In the
                near future you'll be able to display this on the Home screen also.
            </p>

        <div class="landing-feature">
            <h2>Gear</h2>
            <img src="img/gear_20210704.png" alt="Screenshot of WoWthing Gear view">
            <p>
                Keep track of all of that sweet gear you're stuck with for months on end
                because the loot gods never smile upon you.
            </p>

            <p>
                Keep track of your current keystone, Mythic+ Vault status, Raider.IO score, and
                which dungeons you've done at what level in the current week/season.
